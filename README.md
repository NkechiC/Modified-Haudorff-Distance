# Modified-Haudorff-Distance


Many practical applications in topological data analysis arise from data in the form of point clouds, which then yield simplicial complexes. The combinatorial structure of simplicial complexes captures the topological relationships between the elements of the complex. In addition to combinatorial structure, simplicial complexes possess a geometric realization, providing a concrete way to visualize the complex and understand its geometric properties. As such, comparing these simplicial complexes entails a notion of nearness between the vertices, and hence these vertices need to be considered ambient in some metric space. A simplicial complex may be d-dimensional, but its geometric realization may not “fit” into R^d. This project includes R code AND scripts implementing This work presents an amended Hausdorff distance measure for simplicial complexes that integrates geometric proximity with topological features.
